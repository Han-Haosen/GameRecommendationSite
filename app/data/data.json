Those who own races from the first game will have the same races unlocked for multiplayer in the second and a grand campaign map spanning the first and second games' campaign maps will be released in a patch after launch. The game's campaign will be more narrative oriented than the sandbox campaign of the first game with each race battling to save or destroy the Great Vortex over Ulthuan." ,

    "comment": "One of the best historical titles made by Creative Assmebly. It is the most mature product of the entire Total War: Rome family, and also introduced a great amount of in game mechanisms to simulate the downfall of Rome. It is extremely difficult to provide gamers survival experience when all they want is conquer and make their empire bigger, but CA managed to do it using their main campaign. 8/10 ",
    "description": "Total War: Attila is a strategy video game developed by The Creative Assembly and published by Sega, released on 17 February 2015 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux. It is the ninth standalone game in the Total War series of video games.The game begins in 395 AD, during what is now called Late Antiquity (the transition period from Classical Rome to the Medieval age in European history). While the title character will be able to become the leader of the Huns, he is not yet in power at the start of the campaign. Due to its setting near the Dark Ages, the game is possibly a spiritual successor to Rome Total War: Barbarian Invasion.",
